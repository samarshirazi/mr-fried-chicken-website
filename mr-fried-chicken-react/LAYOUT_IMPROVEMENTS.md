# 🎨 Layout Improvements - Mr. Fried Chicken Website

## 📸 Issue Identified
Based on the screenshot analysis, the website had significant layout alignment issues:
- Content appeared heavily right-aligned instead of centered
- Poor container spacing and margins
- Inconsistent responsive behavior
- Layout not utilizing full width properly

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Core CSS Issues**
**Problem:** Default Vite CSS with `body { display: flex; place-items: center }` was causing layout issues
**Solution:** Completely rewrote `src/index.css` with proper reset and layout foundation

```css
/* Before (problematic) */
body {
  margin: 0;
  display: flex;
  place-items: center;
  min-width: 320px;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

/* After (fixed) */
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  min-height: 100vh;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

### 2. **Improved Container System**
- Added custom `.container-custom` class with proper responsive padding
- Updated from basic `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` to `px-6 sm:px-8 lg:px-12 xl:px-16`
- Ensures consistent spacing across all screen sizes

### 3. **Enhanced Hero Section**
**Changes Made:**
- Improved padding from `space-y-8` to `space-y-12` for better spacing
- Enhanced responsive font sizes: `text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl xl:text-8xl`
- Better subtitle responsive sizing
- Wider max-width for better content distribution

### 4. **Better Section Spacing**
- Added `.section-padding` utility class: `py-20 lg:py-32`
- Consistent spacing across all sections
- Better vertical rhythm throughout the site

### 5. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Enhanced responsive breakpoints
- Better mobile padding with specific handling for small screens
- Prevented horizontal overflow with proper max-width constraints

### 6. **Layout Foundation**
**App.jsx Improvements:**
```jsx
// Before
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50 overflow-x-hidden">

// After
<div className="layout-fix">
  <main className="w-full">
```
